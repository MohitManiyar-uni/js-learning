//Datatypes are divided into Primitive and Non Primitive
//Categorised based on how data is kept in memory and how it is accessed

// Primitive (Call by value)// 
// 7 types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

// Reference type (Non Primitive)
// values are referenced directly in memory
//Array, Objects, Functions

let myObj ={
    name:"Mohit",
    age:18,
}
const myFunction =function(){
    console.log("Hello World");
}
console.log(typeof myObj);

//+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

// Stack (Primtive), Heap (Non-Primitive)
